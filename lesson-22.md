# Understanding Blocking vs Non-Blocking code execution in Node.js

Example:  
On a day of board exam results, everybody will try to access their results online.

In a BNPL application,  
assuming that each customer will have a different EMI date.
So we need to collect payment of EMIs on daily basis.
How do we do that without keeping server busy all the time.
